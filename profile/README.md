### Hello! 👋


**What is the HIPE-eval organisation about?** <!-- :upside_down_face: -->

The HIPE-eval organisation grew out of the series of HIPE evaluation campaigns on the **processing of named entity in historical documents**. 
It contains code and datasets related to the campaigns, and is gradually evolving towards hosting other data and developments related 
the evaluation of information extraction systems on historical documents. HIPE stands for '*Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities*'.
<!--(this name was decided upon in a hurry when submitting the first evaluation campaign, and has remained with us )-->


**What are the main HIPE resources?** :hugs:  <!-- for NE processing in historical docs?**   :bar_chart::wrench: -->

- [HIPE-scorer](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-scorer): a python module for evaluating NERC and NEL systems (CLI-based, soon available via hugging-face).
- [HIPE-pycommons](): to manipulate data and get some statistics.
- [HIPE-2022-data](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data): data of the HIPE 2022 shared task.
- [HIPE-2022-eval](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data): all you need to reproduce the HIPE-2022 evaluation campaign results. 
- [HIPE-2022-baseline](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-baseline): baseline models for NERC for HIPE-2022.
- [CLEF-HIPE-2020-eval](https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020-eval): all you need to reproduce the HIPE-2020 evaluation campaign results (in *impresso* GH organisation). 


**Where can I found more on the evaluation campaigns and their results?** :books:

- visit the HIPE-2022 [website](https://hipe-eval.github.io/HIPE-2022/).
- or the CLEF-HIPE-2020 [website](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2020/).
- and the  HIPE Zenodo [organisation](https://zenodo.org/communities/hipe-eval/?page=1&size=20).

**How can I contribute?** 

You are welcome to use the scorer and the data (please note the licences and refer to the relevant scientific papers).    
If you find any errors, please feel free to open issues or pull requests.

**What's to come?** 

We hope to be able to offer another edition of HIPE, and to publish useful data again, so stay tuned!
