The **HIPE-eval** organisation hosts code, datasets and evaluation tools for the **HIPE series of shared tasks on historical document processing**. Originally centred on named entity processing with HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022, HIPE-eval is now expanding to address additional challenges found in noisy, heterogeneous, and multilingual historical documents, including relation extraction and OCR post-correction.

Although **HIPE** first stood for '_Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities'_, the initiative has grown into a **broader umbrella** for shared tasks in historical document processing - but we keep the HIPE name 😊.

**How can I contribute?**    
Feel free to use the scorer, datasets and evaluation material (please respect the licences and cite the relevant papers).  
If you find errors or have improvements to propose, issues and pull requests are welcome!

**What's to come?**     
We hope to be able to offer another edition of HIPE, and to publish useful data again, so stay tuned!

**Funding**    
With the exception of HIPE-2022, HIPE evaluation campaigns are carried out in the context of the [**Impresso - Media Monitoring of the Past**](https://impresso-project.ch) projects. 
The first project (2017-2021) was funded by the **Swiss National Science Foundation** under grant No. [CRSII5_173719](http://p3.snf.ch/project-173719) and the second project (2023-2027)
by the SNSF under grant No. [CRSII5_213585](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/213585) and by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under grant No. 17498891.

**Organisation**    
To date, HIPE evaluation campaigns have been organised jointly by the EPFL Digital Humanities Laboratory  and the UZH Institute of Computational Linguistics. If you would like to organise a shared task under the HIPE umbrella, feel free to get in touch!
